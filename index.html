      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a software developer with an interest for creating software and games.
        Currently on my last year of studying Computer Science with Digipen,
        and have learnt a great deal of knowledge in the field of making games,
        and the processes behind them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Worked with Unity in my journey in game development. 
        I am always eager to learn new technologies and grow my skills.
      </p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p> Here are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>

      <p?>
        <strong>Game Engines</strong><br> 2 custom game engines built in C++, one with a focus on level editors, the other on physics.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Games</strong> <br> Helped make games using custom game engines and on Unity as well.
        They include a 2D puzzle, and a 3D stealth game. <br>
        Unity games include a simple VR quiz game.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mobile</strong> <br> Developed a mobile clicker game in Android Studio in Kotlin. Role here was primarily in the backend,
        with some frontend work as well. For example, I worked a bit on the UI and handled managing multiple databases.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Web Development</strong> <br> Created a simple website using HTML, CSS, and Python.
        Using a combo of Amazon Web Services and Docker to host the website, as well as a team of 4,
        we were able to create a simple website that allows users to send short messages that lasted 24 hours.
